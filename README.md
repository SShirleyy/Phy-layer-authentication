Phy Layer Authentication

PHY-Authentication exploits physical attributes in the hardware and communication
link, called features, to decide whether a transmitter is legitimate.

Theory part is responsible for investigating, modeling and simulating features as 
well as developing authentication algorithms, which will be applied in the offline
post-processing in MATLAB.
1. Reproduce the results of the related work in the literature and adapt the 
algorithms in order to use them in our environment. 
2. Use the MATLAB for post-processing real data, extracted directly from the
Software-Define Radios (SDR) link measurements.


Hardware part focuses on implementing the wireless link using Software-Defined 
Radios (SDR), i.e., with USRP hardware and GNU radio, as well as extracting the 
features of Wi-Fi link for offline data processing. Open issues like real-time 
solution etc will be explored as well.
